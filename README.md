# JavaScript Homework - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

The objective of this homework is to create a basic HTML web page using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects. We write code that appends a table to our web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting. We are then able to filter by dates.
